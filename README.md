# Food Vision Big™ - Image Recognition and Classification

## Project Overview

In this project, I engineered Food Vision Big™, a powerful image recognition system, utilizing the complete Food101 dataset. The dataset consists of 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images spread across 101 food classes.

## Implementation

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

I implemented a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for advanced image recognition and classification. The model has been trained on the extensive Food101 dataset, showcasing its proficiency in handling a diverse range of food images.
